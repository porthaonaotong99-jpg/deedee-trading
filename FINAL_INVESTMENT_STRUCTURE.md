# 🎯 Final Clean Investment System - Per Customer Summary

## 📋 **System Overview**

I have restructured your investment system to have **clear separation** with **per-customer summary tracking**:

### **TABLE 1: `investment_requests`** 
- **Purpose**: Individual payment slip submissions
- **One record per**: Each payment slip upload

### **TABLE 2: `customer_investment_summary`** 
- **Purpose**: ⭐ **TOTAL BALANCES PER CUSTOMER** ⭐
- **One record per**: Customer (aggregated totals)

### **TABLE 3: `investment_transactions`** 
- **Purpose**: Individual investments + all money movements
- **One record per**: Each investment & each transaction

---

## 📊 **TABLE 2: Customer Investment Summary (What You Asked For)**

This table stores **total balances per customer only** - exactly what you requested:

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `total_investment_requests` | How many requests submitted | 5 |
| `approved_investments` | How many approved | 4 |
| `active_investments` | Currently active | 3 |
| `completed_investments` | Fully returned | 1 |
| `total_original_investment` | **Total money ever invested** | "100,000.00" |
| `total_current_balance` | **Current remaining principal** | "75,000.00" |
| `total_interest_earned` | **Total interest calculated** | "12,000.00" |
| `total_interest_paid` | **Total interest paid out** | "8,000.00" |
| `total_principal_returned` | **Total principal returned** | "25,000.00" |
| `outstanding_interest` | **Interest owed to customer** | "4,000.00" |

### **Example Customer Summary:**
```json
{
  "customer_id": "uuid-123",
  "total_original_investment": "100000.00",    // Total invested
  "total_current_balance": "75000.00",         // Current balance  
  "total_interest_earned": "12000.00",         // Total interest
  "total_interest_paid": "8000.00",            // Interest paid
  "total_principal_returned": "25000.00",      // Principal returned
  "outstanding_interest": "4000.00"            // Interest owed
}
```

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **FLOW 1: Customer Invests** 
1. Customer uploads payment slip → Creates `investment_requests`
2. Admin approves → Creates `investment_transactions` (individual investment)
3. **Auto-updates customer summary totals**

### **FLOW 2: Customer Requests Return**
1. Customer requests money → Creates return `investment_transactions`
2. Admin approves → Updates individual investment balances
3. **Auto-updates customer summary totals**

### **FLOW 3: Admin Sends Payment**
1. Admin marks as paid → Creates payment confirmation transaction
2. **Auto-updates customer summary totals**

## 💰 **Customer Summary Auto-Calculation**

The `CustomerInvestmentSummary` table automatically tracks:

### **When Investment Approved:**
```typescript
summary.total_original_investment += approved_amount
summary.total_current_balance += approved_amount  
summary.active_investments += 1
```

### **When Interest Paid:**
```typescript
summary.total_interest_paid += paid_amount
summary.outstanding_interest = total_earned - total_paid
```

### **When Principal Returned:**
```typescript
summary.total_principal_returned += returned_amount
summary.total_current_balance -= returned_amount
```
