# Premium Membership Payment & Subscription System

## Overview

This document describes the complete premium membership payment and subscription system with comprehensive audit logging, type safety, and manual approval workflow.

## Key Features

### 1. Type Safety
- Removed all `any` types throughout the system
- Proper TypeScript interfaces and enums
- Strict type checking for payment operations

### 2. Comprehensive Payment Logging
- Detailed audit trail for all payment actions
- Payment status changes tracked with timestamps
- User context (IP, user agent) captured for security

### 3. Manual Approval Workflow
- Premium membership requires both payment AND admin approval
- Auto-approval only for `premium_stock_picks` service
- Payment confirmation does not automatically activate premium services

### 4. Payment Records System
- Separate payment tracking entity
- Complete payment lifecycle management
- Refund support and partial refund tracking

## System Flow

### Premium Membership Subscription

1. **Customer Application**
   ```typescript
   // Customer applies for premium membership
   POST /customers/{id}/premium-membership/apply
   {
     "duration": "THREE_MONTHS", // or SIX_MONTHS, TWELVE_MONTHS
     "fee": 299.99 // optional, calculated if not provided
   }
   ```

2. **Payment Process**
   - System creates payment intent with MockPaymentService
   - Payment record created with PENDING status
   - Audit log entries created for payment creation and URL generation
   - Customer redirected to payment URL

3. **Payment Confirmation**
   ```typescript
   // Payment provider webhook or manual confirmation
   POST /customers/payment/confirm/{paymentIntentId}
   ```
   - Payment status updated to SUCCEEDED
   - Service remains INACTIVE (requires admin approval)
   - Audit log entry: "Payment confirmed, pending admin approval"

4. **Admin Approval**
   ```typescript
   // Admin approves the service
   POST /customers/services/{serviceId}/approve
   {
     "reviewerUserId": "admin-user-id"
   }
   ```
   - Service activated
   - Audit logs: Admin approval + subscription activation
   - Customer can now access premium features

### Premium Membership Renewal

1. **Renewal Request**
   ```typescript
   POST /customers/{id}/premium-membership/renew
   {
     "duration": "SIX_MONTHS",
     "fee": 549.99
   }
   ```

2. **Renewal Payment & Approval**
   - Same payment process as initial subscription
   - Creates new service record for renewal
   - Requires payment + admin approval
   - Old service deactivated when renewal approved

## Audit Logging

### Payment Actions Tracked
- `PAYMENT_CREATED` - Payment record created
- `PAYMENT_INITIATED` - Payment process started
- `PAYMENT_URL_GENERATED` - Payment URL created
- `PAYMENT_SUCCEEDED` - Payment completed successfully
- `PAYMENT_FAILED` - Payment failed with reason
- `PAYMENT_CANCELED` - Payment canceled by user
- `PAYMENT_REFUNDED` - Full or partial refund processed

### Subscription Actions Tracked
- `SUBSCRIPTION_ACTIVATED` - Service activated
- `SUBSCRIPTION_RENEWAL_REQUESTED` - Renewal initiated
- `SUBSCRIPTION_RENEWAL_ACTIVATED` - Renewal approved and activated
- `ADMIN_APPROVAL_PENDING` - Waiting for admin approval
- `ADMIN_APPROVED` - Admin approved service
- `ADMIN_REJECTED` - Admin rejected service

### Audit Context
Each audit log includes:
- Payment ID and Customer ID
- Action type and description
- Metadata (amounts, service types, etc.)
- User context (IP address, user agent)
- Performer ID (for admin actions)
- Timestamps

## Service Configuration

```

- Payments pending approval > 24 hours
- Unusual audit log patterns
- Multiple failed attempts from same IP
- High-value transactions requiring review

## Testing Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. Customer applies for premium membership
2. Customer completes payment successfully
3. Admin approves subscription
4. Customer accesses premium features
5. Customer renews before expiration

### Error Scenarios
1. Payment failure handling
2. Admin rejection workflow
3. Expired payment URLs
4. Duplicate applications
5. Renewal of non-existent subscription

### Security Testing
1. Payment URL tampering
2. Replay attack prevention
3. Admin privilege escalation
4. Audit log integrity
5. Rate limiting effectiveness

## Compliance

### Data Retention
- Payment records: 7 years minimum
- Audit logs: 7 years minimum
- Customer PII: Per GDPR requirements
- Transaction metadata: Per financial regulations

### Privacy
- Payment data encrypted at rest
- PII access logged and monitored
- Customer consent tracked
- Data export capabilities for GDPR

This system provides a secure, auditable, and scalable foundation for premium membership subscriptions with proper payment processing and admin oversight.
