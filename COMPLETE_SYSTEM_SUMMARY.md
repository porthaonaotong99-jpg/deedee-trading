## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### 1. Customer Submits Investment
- POST `/investment-requests`
- System calculates tier based on amount
- System applies risk tolerance adjustment
- Returns calculated interest rate
- Stores request for admin review

### 2. Admin Reviews Request
- GET `/investment-requests/pending`
- PUT `/investment-requests/{id}/approve`
- System creates investment record with calculated rate

### 3. Admin Manages Configurations
- GET `/admin/interest-rates` - View all configurations
- POST `/admin/interest-rates` - Create new configuration
- PUT `/admin/interest-rates/{id}` - Update existing
- POST `/admin/interest-rates/calculate` - Test calculations

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Database Migration
Execute the migration to create the `interest_rate_configurations` table:
```sql
-- Run database migration
npm run migration:run
```

### 2. Seed Default Data
Use the seeding functionality to populate initial configurations:
```bash
# The service will automatically seed default configurations on first use
```

### 3. Test API Endpoints
Use the provided mock data to test all endpoints:
- Customer investment submissions
- Admin approval workflows
- Interest rate configuration management

### 4. Validation
Verify the complete workflow:
- Interest rates calculated correctly based on amount and risk
- Database stores and retrieves configurations properly
- API responses match expected formats
