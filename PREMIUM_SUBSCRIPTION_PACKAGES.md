# Premium Subscription Packages

This document describes the new server-authoritative subscription package system for Premium Membership.

## Rationale
Previously, the client supplied `subscription.duration` and optional `fee` when applying for a premium membership. This presented several problems:
- Trust boundary violation: client could manipulate fee.
- Difficulty adjusting pricing centrally.
- Swagger/API complexity with inline structures.

The new design introduces a `subscription_packages` table. Each package row defines:
- `id` (UUID)
- `service_type` (currently only `premium_membership` supported here)
- `duration_months` (3, 6, 12, etc.)
- `price` + `currency`
- `description`
- `active` flag for soft-retirement of packages

The client now submits only:
```
POST /customers/services/premium-membership/apply
{
  "service_type": "premium_membership",
  "package_id": "<uuid>",
  "payment_slip": { ... }
}
```

The backend loads the package, validates it is active, derives the duration and fee, and ensures the slip payment matches the canonical price.

## Migration
A TypeORM migration `1733330000000-create-subscription-packages.ts` creates the table and seeds default 3/6/12-month packages if they do not already exist.

## Backward Compatibility
The DTO keeps a deprecated `subscription` field temporarily. Any logic now ignores it in favor of `package_id`. Plan removal after all clients are updated. Recommended deprecation window: 1 release.

## Validation Flow
1. Verify customer has no existing active premium membership.
2. Fetch package by `id`, `service_type=premium_membership`, `active=true`.
3. Map `duration_months` to enum `SubscriptionDuration` (reject unsupported values).
4. Convert numeric string `price` to number; validate `payment_slip.payment_amount` matches (Â±0.01 tolerance for floating point).
5. Apply service with derived duration & fee; create pending payment record with slip data.

## Operational Notes
- Adjust or add new packages via SQL or an admin UI (future enhancement). Set `active=false` to retire packages without breaking historical records.
- Price changes: create a new package row instead of updating historical one if you need auditability; or update in-place if audit isn't required (decide policy).
- Consider unique constraint `(service_type, duration_months, active)` if you want to disallow multiple active packages for the same duration.

## Future Enhancements
- Introduce `version` or `effective_from` fields for scheduled pricing changes.
- Expose `GET /public/subscription-packages?service_type=premium_membership` for clients to dynamically fetch offerings.
- Add audit logging around package creation/modification.
- Add caching layer (e.g., Redis) if package list grows or is requested frequently.

## Removal Plan for Deprecated Field
Target removal steps:
1. Mark `subscription` field as deprecated in Swagger (already documented).
2. After N days/releases, remove field from DTO and controller examples.
3. Remove any fallback logic (currently none) and cleanup docs.

This system improves pricing integrity, central governance, and clarity of the premium membership application flow.
