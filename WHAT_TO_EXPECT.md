## 💰 **Paper Trading vs Live Trading**

### **Paper Trading (Current Setup)**
| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Money** | Virtual ($1M default) |
| **Orders** | Simulated execution |
| **Market Data** | Real-time |
| **Risk** | Zero financial risk |
| **Learning** | Perfect for development |
| **Errors** | Safe to make mistakes |

### **Live Trading (Future)**
| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|

| **Orders** | Real market execution |
| **Market Data** | Real-time |
| **Risk** | 100% financial risk |
