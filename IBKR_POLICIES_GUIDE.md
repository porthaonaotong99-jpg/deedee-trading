📊 Options: $4.50/month
📊 Forex: Free with account
📊 Futures: Varies by exchange
```

## 🔐 **API Security Policies**

### **1. Connection Security**
```
✅ API connections must be from trusted IPs only
✅ Use secure networks (avoid public WiFi)
✅ Implement proper authentication
✅ Monitor for unauthorized access
```

### **2. Client ID Management**
```
✅ Each application needs unique Client ID
✅ Don't share Client IDs between applications
✅ Use sequential IDs (1, 2, 3, etc.)
✅ Max 32 simultaneous connections per account
```

### **3. Order Management Responsibilities**
```
⚠️ YOU are responsible for ALL orders placed via API
⚠️ No "it was a bug" excuses for losses
⚠️ Must implement proper error handling
⚠️ Must have risk management controls
```

## 📊 **Rate Limiting & Performance Policies**

### **Message Rate Limits**
```
📈 Market Data Requests: 50 per second max
📈 Order Requests: 50 per second max  
📈 Account Requests: 50 per second max
📈 Historical Data: 60 requests per 10 minutes
```

**Best Practice Implementation:**
```typescript
class RateLimiter {
  private requests: number[] = [];
  private readonly maxRequestsPerSecond = 45; // Stay under 50 limit
  
  canMakeRequest(): boolean {
    const now = Date.now();
    this.requests = this.requests.filter(time => now - time < 1000);
    return this.requests.length < this.maxRequestsPerSecond;
  }
  
  recordRequest(): void {
    this.requests.push(Date.now());
  }
}
```

### **Connection Stability**
```
✅ Maintain stable TWS/Gateway connection
✅ Handle disconnections gracefully  
✅ Implement automatic reconnection
✅ Don't spam connection attempts
```

## ⚖️ **Regulatory Compliance Policies**

### **1. Pattern Day Trading (PDT) Rules**
```
⚠️ If account < $25,000: Max 3 day trades per 5 business days
⚠️ If account ≥ $25,000: Unlimited day trades allowed
⚠️ Violation = 90-day restriction on day trading
⚠️ API orders count toward PDT calculations
```

**Implementation Example:**
```typescript
class PDTMonitor {
  private dayTrades: Date[] = [];
  private accountBalance: number;
  
  canPlaceDayTrade(): boolean {
    if (this.accountBalance >= 25000) return true;
    
    const fiveDaysAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 5 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    this.dayTrades = this.dayTrades.filter(date => date > fiveDaysAgo);
    
    return this.dayTrades.length < 3;
  }
}
```

### **2. Wash Sale Rules**
```
⚠️ Can't deduct losses if you rebuy same security within 30 days
⚠️ Applies to substantially identical securities
⚠️ API must track and warn about potential wash sales
⚠️ Required for tax reporting accuracy
```

### **3. Market Making Rules**
```
❌ Don't place orders that could be considered market making
❌ Avoid rapid order cancellations and replacements
❌ Don't place orders on both sides of market simultaneously

    if (this.port !== 7497 || !this.accountId.startsWith('DU')) {
      throw new Error('Must use paper trading for development');
    }
  }
  
  // Log everything extensively
  logActivity(activity: string, data: any): void {
    this.logger.log(`[PAPER] ${activity}`, data);
  }
}
```

### **2. Testing Phase**
```typescript
class TestingSafety {
  // Test every error condition
  testErrorScenarios(): void {
    // Connection failures
    // Invalid orders  
    // Market closures
    // Data feed issues
    // Margin calls
  }
  
  // Validate all edge cases
  validateEdgeCases(): void {
    // Zero quantities
    // Negative prices  
    // Invalid symbols
    // Market holidays
  }
}
```

### **3. Production Phase (Live Trading)**
```typescript
class ProductionSafety {
  // Multiple layers of validation
  validateOrder(order: Order): void {
    this.validateSizeLimit(order);
    this.validatePriceReasonableness(order);
    this.validateRiskLimits(order);
    this.validateRegulatory(order);
  }
  
  // Emergency procedures
  emergencyShutdown(): void {
    this.cancelAllOrders();
    this.closeAllPositions();
    this.disconnectAPI();
    this.alertAdministrators();
  }
}
```
