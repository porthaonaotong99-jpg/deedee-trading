# Controller Updates Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. **Removed `payment_status` Reference**
- **Problem**: The controller was trying to access `payment_status` from `CustomerService` entity, which caused a TypeScript error because this field was removed in favor of the separate Payment entity system.
- **Solution**: Removed the `payment_status` field from the subscription response in the `applyPremiumMembership` endpoint.

### 2. **Implemented Renewal Functionality**
- **Problem**: The renewal endpoint was a placeholder that returned "feature coming soon".
- **Solution**: Connected the endpoint to the new `renewPremiumMembership` service method.

### 3. **Enhanced Service Approval**
- **Problem**: The approval endpoint didn't handle payment-based services properly.
- **Solution**: Updated to work with the new approval system that handles both KYC-based and payment-based services.

## New Controller Endpoints

### Customer Endpoints
1. **`POST /customers/services/subscriptions/renew`** - Initiate premium membership renewal
2. **`POST /customers/services/renewals/payments/:paymentId/confirm`** - Confirm renewal payment
3. **`GET /customers/services/payments/history`** - Get payment history (placeholder)

### Admin Endpoints
1. **`POST /customers/services/renewals/:serviceId/approve`** - Approve paid renewal
2. **`GET /customers/services/admin/payments/audit`** - Get payment audit logs (placeholder)

## Updated Endpoints

### 1. **Premium Membership Application**
- **Endpoint**: `POST /customers/services/premium-membership/apply`
- **Changes**: Removed invalid `payment_status` field from response
- **Response Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "pending_payment",
    "service_type": "premium_membership", 
    "service_id": "uuid",
    "payment": {
      "payment_id": "stripe_intent_id",
      "payment_url": "https://checkout.stripe.com/...",
      "amount": 299.99,
      "currency": "USD",
      "expires_at": "2023-10-02T12:00:00Z"
    },
    "subscription": {
      "service_type": "premium_membership",
      "active": false,
      "subscription_duration": 3,
      "subscription_expires_at": "2024-01-02T00:00:00Z",
      "subscription_fee": 299.99,
      "applied_at": "2023-10-02T09:00:00Z"
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. **Service Approval**
- **Endpoint**: `POST /customers/services/:serviceId/approve`
- **Changes**: 
  - Fixed parameter binding (was using `@Body('serviceId')`, now using `@Param('serviceId')`)
  - Added support for payment information in response
  - Updated to handle payment-based services that require payment completion before approval
- **Response Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "activated",
    "service_id": "uuid",
    "service_type": "premium_membership",
    "kyc_level": "basic",
    "payment": {
      "id": "payment_uuid",
      "amount": 299.99,
      "status": "succeeded"
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. **Payment Confirmation**
- **Endpoint**: `POST /customers/services/payments/:paymentId/confirm`
- **Changes**: Updated to work with new payment system that requires admin approval for premium services
- **Behavior**: 
  - For premium membership: Payment confirmed but service remains inactive until admin approval
  - For other services: Immediate activation if no admin approval required

## API Flow for Premium Membership

### Initial Subscription
1. `POST /premium-membership/apply` → Creates payment intent + service record
2. Customer completes payment via payment URL
3. `POST /payments/:id/confirm` → Confirms payment, service pending admin approval
4. `POST /:serviceId/approve` → Admin approves, service activated

### Renewal
1. `POST /subscriptions/renew` → Creates renewal payment intent + new service record
2. Customer completes payment via payment URL  
3. `POST /renewals/payments/:id/confirm` → Confirms renewal payment, pending admin approval
4. `POST /renewals/:serviceId/approve` → Admin approves renewal, old service deactivated

## Type Safety Improvements

- Removed all unsafe `any` type assignments
- Fixed parameter binding issues
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for all request/response objects
- Null-safe property access throughout

## Security Enhancements

- Proper authentication guards on all endpoints
- Customer vs Admin endpoint separation
- Payment confirmation restricted to payment owners
- Admin approval restricted to internal users

The controller now provides a complete, type-safe API for the premium membership payment and subscription system with proper manual approval workflow and comprehensive audit logging.
