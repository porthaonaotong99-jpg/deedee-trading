# Payment Slip Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the customer stock picks system with a simple payment slip workflow where customers submit payment proof and admins directly approve or reject.

## Payment Workflow
1. **Customer Selection**: Customer selects stock pick (status: `SELECTED`)
2. **Payment Submission**: Customer submits payment slip with proof of payment (status: `PAYMENT_SUBMITTED`)
3. **Admin Approval**: Admin reviews payment slip and directly approves/rejects (status: `APPROVED` or `REJECTED`)
4. **Email Delivery**: System sends email with stock symbol to customer if approved

## Database Changes

### CustomerStockPick Entity Updates
- Added payment slip fields:
  - `payment_slip_url`: URL to uploaded payment slip file
  - `payment_slip_filename`: Original filename of payment slip
  - `payment_amount`: Amount paid by customer
  - `payment_reference`: Payment reference/transaction ID
  - `payment_submitted_at`: Timestamp of payment submission

### Status Enum Updates
Added new status value to `CustomerPickStatus`:
- `PAYMENT_SUBMITTED`: Payment slip uploaded, awaiting admin approval

## API Endpoints

### Customer Endpoints
- `POST /stock-picks/selections/:id/payment-slip` - Submit payment slip for a selected stock pick

### Admin Endpoints
- `GET /admin/stock-picks/pending-approvals` - Get customer picks with payment slips awaiting approval
- `PUT /admin/stock-picks/customer-picks/:id/approve` - Approve customer pick after reviewing payment
- `POST /admin/stock-picks/customer-picks/:id/reject` - Reject customer pick

## DTOs and Validation

### CustomerSubmitPaymentSlipDto
```typescript
{
  payment_slip_url: string;      // Required, valid URL
  payment_slip_filename: string; // Required
  payment_amount: number;        // Required, min 0.01
  payment_reference?: string;    // Optional
  payment_notes?: string;        // Optional
}
```



### CustomerStockPickResponseDto (Updated)
Added payment slip fields to response DTO for complete payment tracking.

## Service Methods

### StockPicksService Updates
- `submitPaymentSlip()`: Handle customer payment slip submission
- `getPendingApprovals()`: Get picks with payment slips awaiting admin approval
- `approveCustomerPick()`: Updated to require `PAYMENT_SUBMITTED` status before approval

## Type Safety Improvements
- Fixed ManyToOne relation type safety in entity
- Removed all 'any' types throughout the codebase
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces and validation
- Comprehensive input validation with class-validator

## Security Features
- Customer can only submit payment slips for their own selections
- Payment verification restricted to admin users only
- Status validation prevents invalid state transitions
- Transaction-based updates ensure data consistency

## Migration
Database migration provided in `database/migrations/add_payment_slip_to_customer_stock_picks.sql`

## File Upload Integration
The system expects payment slip files to be uploaded through a separate file upload service, with the URL provided in the payment slip submission.

## Email Integration
Stock symbols are only sent via email after both payment verification AND final admin approval, ensuring complete payment validation before symbol disclosure.

## Admin Dashboard Support
Admin controllers provide simple endpoints for:
- Viewing customer picks with payment slips awaiting approval
- Directly approving or rejecting picks based on payment slip review
- Complete audit trail of admin approval decisions

This implementation provides a streamlined payment slip workflow where admins can quickly review payment proofs and make approval decisions, ensuring stock symbols are only sent after payment verification.
